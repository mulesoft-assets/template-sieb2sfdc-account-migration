I want to synchronize accounts from Oracle Siebel Business Objects to Salesforce instance.

This Template should serve as a foundation for the process of migrating accounts from Oracle Siebel Business Objects to Salesfoce instance, being able to specify filtering criteria and desired behavior when an account already exists in the Salesforce. 

As implemented, this Template leverage the [Batch Module](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing).
The batch job is divided to Input, Process and On Complete stages.
During the Input stage the Template will query Siebel for all the existing Accounts that match the filter criteria.
During the Process stage, each Account will be filtered depending on, if it has an existing matching account in the Salesforce and if the last updated date of the later is greater than the one of Siebel.
The last step of the Process stage will group the accounts and create them in Salesforce.
Finally during the On Complete stage the Template will both output statistics data into the console and send a notification email with the results of the batch execution.

In order to make the siebel connector work smoothly you have to provide the correct version of the siebel jars (Siebel.jar, SiebelJI_enu.jar) that works with your Siebel installation.

**Note:** This particular Anypoint Template illustrate the migration use case between Oracle Siebel Business Objects and a Database, thus it requires a Oracle Siebel Business Objects instance to work.

In any of the ways you would like to run this Template this is an example of the output you'll see after hitting the HTTP endpoint:

<pre>
<h1>Batch Process initiated</h1>
<b>ID:</b>6eea3cc6-7c96-11e3-9a65-55f9f3ae584e<br/>

Once your app is all set and started, supposing you choose as domain name `sieb2sfdcaccountmigration` to trigger the use case you just need to hit `http://sieb2sfdcaccountmigration.cloudhub.io/migrateaccounts` and report will be sent to the e-mails configured.

		<section id="api_calls">
		<![CDATA[
SalesForce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made. Therefore calculating this amount may be an important factor to consider. The Anypoint Template calls to the API can be calculated using the formula:

***X + X / 200***

Being ***X*** the number of Accounts to be synchronized on each run. 

The division by ***200*** is because, by default, Accounts are gathered in groups of 200 for each Upsert API Call in the commit step. 

For instance if 10 records are fetched from origin instance, then 11 api calls to Salesforce will be made (10 + 1).

This is the file where you can find the inbound and outbound sides of your integration app.
This Template has only a [HTTP Connector](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/HTTP+Connector) as the way to trigger the use case.

**HTTP Connector** - Start Report Generation
+ `${http.port}` is set as a property to be defined either on a property file or in CloudHub environment variables.
+ The path configured by default is `migrateaccounts` and you are free to change for the one you prefer.
+ The host name for all endpoints in your CloudHub configuration should be defined as `localhost`. CloudHub will then route requests from your application domain URL to the endpoint.

This file holds the functional aspect of the Anypoint Template, directed by one flow responsible of conducting the business logic.
For the purpose of this particular Template the *mainFlow* just executes a [Batch Job](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing) which handles all its logic.
This flow has Exception Strategy that basically consists on invoking the *defaultChoiseExceptionStrategy* defined in *errorHandling.xml* file.
