# License Agreement <a name="licenseagreement"/>
Note that using this template is subject to the conditions of this [License Agreement](AnypointTemplateLicense.pdf).
Please review the terms of the license before downloading and using this template. In short, you are allowed to use the template for free with Mule ESB Enterprise Edition, CloudHub, or as a trial in Anypoint Studio.

# Use Case <a name="usecase"/>
I want to synchronize accounts from Oracle Siebel Business Objects to Salesforce instance.

This Template should serve as a foundation for the process of migrating accounts from Oracle Siebel Business Objects to Salesfoce instance, being able to specify filtering criteria and desired behavior when an account already exists in the Salesforce. 

As implemented, this Template leverage the [Batch Module](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing).
The batch job is divided to Input, Process and On Complete stages.
During the Input stage the Template will query Siebel for all the existing Accounts that match the filter criteria.
During the Process stage, each Account will be filtered depending on, if it has an existing matching account in the Salesforce and if the last updated date of the later is greater than the one of Siebel.
The last step of the Process stage will group the accounts and create them in Salesforce.
Finally during the On Complete stage the Template will both output statistics data into the console and send a notification email with the results of the batch execution. 


# Run it! <a name="runit"/>

Simple steps to get Siebel to Salesforce Accounts Migration running.

**Note:** This particular Anypoint Template illustrate the migration use case between Oracle Siebel Business Objects and a Database, thus it requires a Oracle Siebel Business Objects instance to work.

In any of the ways you would like to run this Template this is an example of the output you'll see after hitting the HTTP endpoint:

<pre>
<h1>Batch Process initiated</h1>
<b>ID:</b>6eea3cc6-7c96-11e3-9a65-55f9f3ae584e<br/>
<b>Records to Be Processed: </b>9<br/>
<b>Start execution on: </b>Mon Jan 13 18:05:33 GMT-03:00 2014
</pre>


## Running on premise <a name="runonopremise"/>

In this section we detail the way you have to run you Anypoint Temple on you computer.

### Running on Studio <a name="runonstudio"/>
Once you have imported you Anypoint Template into Anypoint Studio you need to follow these steps to run it:

+ Locate the properties file `mule.dev.properties`, in src/main/resources
+ Complete all the properties required as per the examples in the section [Properties to be configured](#propertiestobeconfigured)
+ Once that is done, right click on you Anypoint Template project folder 
+ Hover you mouse over `"Run as"`
+ Click on  `"Mule Application"`


### Running on Mule ESB stand alone <a name="runonmuleesbstandalone"/> 
Complete all properties in one of the property files, for example in [mule.prod.properties](../blob/master/src/main/resources/mule.prod.properties) and run your app with the corresponding environment variable to use it. To follow the example, this will be `mule.env=prod`.


## Running on CloudHub <a name="runoncloudhub"/>

While [creating your application on CloudHub](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Hello+World+on+CloudHub) (Or you can do it later as a next step), you need to go to Deployment > Advanced to set all environment variables detailed in **Properties to be configured** as well as the **mule.env**. 

Once your app is all set and started, supposing you choose as domain name `sieb2sfdcaccountmigration` to trigger the use case you just need to hit `http://sieb2sfdcaccountmigration.cloudhub.io/migrateaccounts` and report will be sent to the e-mails configured.

### Deploying your Anypoint Template on CloudHub <a name="deployingyouranypointtemplateoncloudhub"/>
Mule Studio provides you with really easy way to deploy your Anypoint Template directly to CloudHub, for the specific steps to do so please check this [link](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Deploying+Mule+Applications#DeployingMuleApplications-DeploytoCloudHub)

## Properties to be configured (With examples)<a name="propertiestobeconfigured"/>
In order to use this Anypoint Template you need to configure properties (Credentials, configurations, etc.) either in properties file or in CloudHub as Environment Variables. Detail list with examples:

### Application configuration
+ http.port `9090` 

#### Oracle Siebel Business Objects Connector configuration
+ sieb.user `SADMIN`
+ sieb.password `SADMIN`
+ sieb.server `192.168.10.8`
+ sieb.serverName `SBA_82`
+ sieb.objectManager `EAIObjMgr_enu`
+ sieb.port `2321`

#### SalesForce Connector configuration
+ sfdc.username `joan.baez@org`
+ sfdc.password `JoanBaez456`
+ sfdc.securityToken `ces56arl7apQs56XTddf34X`
+ sfdc.url `https://login.salesforce.com/services/Soap/u/26.0`

#### E-Mail Details
+ mail.from `batch.migrateaccounts.migration%40mulesoft.com`
+ mail.to `cesar.garcia@mulesoft.com`
+ mail.subject `Batch Job Finished Report`

# Customize It!<a name="customizeit"/>
This brief guide intends to give a high level idea of how this Anypoint Template is built and how you can change it according to your needs.
As mule applications are based on XML files, this page will be organized by describing all the XML that conform the Anypoint Template.
Of course more files will be found such as Test Classes and [Mule Application Files](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Application+Format), but to keep it simple we will focus on the XMLs.

Here is a list of the main XML files you'll find in this application:

* [config.xml](#configxml)
* [endpoints.xml](#endpointsxml)
* [businessLogic.xml](#businesslogicxml)
* [errorHandling.xml](#errorhandlingxml)


## config.xml<a name="configxml"/>
This file holds the configuration for Connectors and [Properties Place Holders](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Configuring+Properties) are set in this file. 
**Even you can change the configuration here, all parameters that can be modified here are in properties file, and this is the recommended place to do it so.** 
Of course if you want to do core changes to the logic you will probably need to modify this file.

In the visual editor they can be found on the *Global Element* tab.


## endpoints.xml<a name="endpointsxml"/>
This is the file where you will found the inbound and outbound sides of your integration app.
This Template has only an [HTTP Inbound Endpoint](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/HTTP+Endpoint+Reference) as the way to trigger the use case.

###  Inbound Flow
**HTTP Inbound Endpoint** - Start Report Generation
+ `${http.port}` is set as a property to be defined either on a property file or in CloudHub environment variables.
+ The path configured by default is `migrateaccounts` and you are free to change for the one you prefer.
+ The host name for all endpoints in your CloudHub configuration should be defined as `localhost`. CloudHub will then route requests from your application domain URL to the endpoint.
+ The endpoint is configured as a *request-response* since as a result of calling it the response will be the total of Accounts synced and filtered by the criteria specified.

## businessLogic.xml<a name="businesslogicxml"/>
This file holds the functional aspect of the Anypoint Template, directed by one flow responsible of conducting the business logic.
For the purpose of this particular Template the *mainFlow* just executes a [Batch Job](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing). which handles all the logic of it.
This flow has Exception Strategy that basically consists on invoking the *defaultChoiseExceptionStrategy* defined in *errorHandling.xml* file.

## errorHandling.xml<a name="errorhandlingxml"/>
This is the right place to handle how your integration will react depending on the different exceptions. 
This file holds a [Choice Exception Strategy](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Choice+Exception+Strategy) that is referenced by the main flow in the business logic.

## Testing the Anypoint Template <a name="testingtheanypointtemplate"/>

You will notice that the Template has been shipped with test.
These devidi them self into two categories:

+ Unit Tests
+ Integration Tests

You can run any of them by just doing right click on the class and clicking on run as JUnit test.

Do bear in mind that you'll have to tell the test classes which property file to use.
For you convenience we have added a file mule.test.properties located in "src/test/resources".
In the run configurations of the test just make sure to add the following property:

+ -Dmule.env=test
